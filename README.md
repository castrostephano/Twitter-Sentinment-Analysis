# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
The goal of this project was to use TextBlob, an API used for natural language processing (NLP), to run a sentiment analysis on tweets. 

This project is an exercise on using pandas and TextBlob to analyze the polarity of a series of tweets.
There would be negative polarity in a negative comment and a positive comment would have positive polarity.
The negative and positve polarity texts are displayed on word clouds.
