# TwitterSentiment
Twitter sentiment analysis using TextBlob, an API used for natural language processing (NLP)

This project is an exercise on using mostly pandas and TextBlob to analyze the polarity of a series of tweets.
There would be negative polarity in a negative comment and a positive comment would have positive polarity.
The findings are displayed in a word cloud
